# elearning-website-internship-
This repository contains the codebase for an e-learning website. The website has two user roles - learner and instructor. Learners can access and complete different modules, upload files, assignments, and take quizzes. Instructors can create modules, upload content, create assignments, and manage grades.

The learner module is designed to help students learn and grow by accessing educational resources, while the instructor module provides a platform for teachers to share and manage educational content.

The website is built using XAMPP and PHP for the back-end, while the front-end is developed using HTML and CSS. The database is also managed using XAMPP and PHPMyAdmin.
